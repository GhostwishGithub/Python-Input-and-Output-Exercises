#Continuing my practice with python
# #Exercise 1: Accept numbers from a user
# #Write a program to accept two numbers from the user and calculate multiplication
# #Basic stuff, input and what not.
# #Two numbers, so, two declarations
# num1 = int(input("Input the first number: "))
# num2 = int(input("Input the second number: "))
# #then multiply them together
# res = num1 * num2
# print("The multiplication is", res)
# Commented out exercise 1 for expediency
